## Trivia

"Red bean battleship", "Cola gummy warship" and "Jelly cube gunkan" were the *creative* iconic dishes of Ming General Japanese Sushi Restaurant(名將壽司), beloved by Hong Kongers who have a really good sense of humor and the courage to try hellish food. 
Unfortunately the last branch of them already closed in Mar, 2020.
